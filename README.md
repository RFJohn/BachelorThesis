# BachelorThesis

This is mono repository for all the work I do on my thesis.

- In thesis you will find my written pages

- In downscale_code you will find code files i coded independent of frameworks. 

- The *-fork folders are cloned master branches of the specific repository. The code in there will be adjusted to accomodate my specific needs like specific data loading etc.

# Known Issues

    cannot import name 'PILLOW_VERSION' from PIL

=> can be fixed by installing an older pillow version, for example:

    conda install pillow=6.2.1 -y
